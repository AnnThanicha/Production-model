BRIED DISCRIPTION OF FILES AND THEIR CONTENTS:
The .R scripts and .csv files that have been included are necessary files for the model to run. 
Files can be adapted and/or disregarded when the model is being adapted for situations other than its original use.

#~ ProdMod.R
This script is where the model is written. In it you will find two functions; 
	i)  mkFrames() is the actual simulation model simulating cow- and hoof-level events for a herd.
	ii) MySim2() iterates mkFrames() depending on the number of desired simulations. 
	    Ouput is either stored in the RAM or locally depending on the `limS` and `clb` arguments.

#~ Prod_run.R
This script deals with running the model and storing the data per iteration locally as .csv files. 
Its use is intended for final simulations once the model is complete.

#~ Quick_run.R
This is a script that sources the model and runs one simulation. The simulation is timed and a few model outputs are presented:
	i) Average lactation curves with variation per parity are visualised
	ii) Parity distributions
	iii) Number of cows culled per culling reason

#~ ProdMod_defaultParameters.R
This script is where all the default parameters are written. 
They are stored in a list called `xPRM`. `xPRM` is then saved as an .Rdata file as `ProdMod_defaultParameters.R` and sourced 
when `mkFrames()` is run. 
A few other scripts are sourced as inputs in this script.


#~ ProdMod_internalFunc.R
Internal functions used for certain processes in `mkFrames()` are written here. 
The script is sourced before running the model.

#~ daysOpen_func.R 
This script simulates the expected number of days open after calving depending on a cows relative production level (RPL)
and aids fertility related culling decisions. 
This based on Dutch data as mentioned in the script.

#~ daysOpen_mat.csv
Simulated data generated by the function in daysOpen_func.R. 
The data describes the average number of days open for a cow with a certain RPL and is dependent on the herd size. 
Data is used in the model for fertility culling related decisions. Data is sourced before the model is run.
